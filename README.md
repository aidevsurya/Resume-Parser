Hello Guys, I Built an intelligent resume parser using Python and NLP to extract structured data from unstructured resume files, enabling automation in candidate screening and HR workflows. <br>

# Installation and Run
<code> pip install spacy, PyPDF2, pandas, doc2text </code>
<code> python resume_parser.py </code> <br>
Currently It will automatically take "resume1.py" file just for demo purpose, If you want this program to use for your own work, Drop an email at suryansh070104@gmail.com to tweak this according to your requirements.
